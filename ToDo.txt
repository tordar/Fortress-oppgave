1. Set up a basic Router with React Router

2. Add custom styling to each component with Styled Components

3. Create these components:
    - Header (customised to change between Login and Sign up, with added information, which can stay at default)
    - GoogleBtn (customised to change between Sign up and Sign in)
    - Input (Custom values, labels, placeholders - Can be used as many times as necessary)
    - Radio (Switch, which can change between 'remember password' or 'terms and condition')
    - LoginInfo (Info with a-tag switching between create account and login)

4. All of these components go inside two main components named:
    - Login
    - Signin
    These will have the same blue right screen, which can have different pictures, but the same underlying textfield
    These are the two main components which we need to be able to switch between, with the React Router

5. Everything needs to be mobile responsive

6. Deploy site via Netlify
